# Snake Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Python's Turtle module.

## Files

- `Snake.py`: Contains the `Snake` class which represents the snake in the game. It handles the movement and behavior of the snake.
- `food.py`: Defines the `Food` class responsible for managing the food that the snake eats. It handles the appearance and position of the food.
- `scoreboard.py`: Defines the `Scoreboard` class which keeps track of the player's score and displays it on the screen.
- `main.py`: The main file that runs the game. It initializes the game window, sets up the game components, and contains the game loop.

## Usage

To play the game, run `main.py`. Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake. Eat the food to grow the snake and earn points. Avoid running into the walls or into the snake itself.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Turtle module (included in Python standard library)
